description: "The Bride of Lammermoor is a historical novel by Sir Walter Scott, published\
  \ in 1819. The novel is set in the Lammermuir Hills of south-east Scotland, and\
  \ tells of a tragic love affair between young Lucy Ashton and her family's enemy\
  \ Edgar Ravenswood. Scott indicated the plot was based on an actual incident. The\
  \ Bride of Lammermoor and A Legend of Montrose were published together as the third\
  \ of Scott's Tales of My Landlord series. As with all the Waverley Novels, The Bride\
  \ of Lammermuir was published anonymously. The novel claims that the story was an\
  \ oral tradition, collected by one \"Peter Pattieson\", and subsequently published\
  \ by \"Jedediah Cleishbotham\". The 1830 \"Waverley edition\" includes an introduction\
  \ by Scott, discussing his actual sources. The later edition also changes the date\
  \ of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830\
  \ edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which\
  \ joined Scotland and England. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera\
  \ Lucia di Lammermoor.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
